JACK2 is a low-latency audio server for multi-processor machines.
It provides a basic infrastructure for audio applications to communicate with each other and with audio hardware.
Through JACK, users are enabled to build powerful systems for signal processing and music production.

This package installs jackd and the command-line tools for JACK2.

It also includes the necessary files for developers to build with JACK support.


The previously packaged JackRouter plugin is not available at this point.
